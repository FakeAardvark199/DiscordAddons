I'm still learning alot about both css and javascript
(js) but will be developing multiple themes and plugins,
Once I know how to express these ideas in code,
alot of which will be used together. 
I am however very busy sadly 
admitted with more to do then I can fit in
so development will be slow
dont use any addons in this repository as they are incomplete
any themes or plugins in this repository will most likely be broken 
(if theres any code there in the first place)
and it may just waste room in either your plugins/themes folders 
or make certain aspect of discord inaccessible, 
you have been warned this is still very early
development
